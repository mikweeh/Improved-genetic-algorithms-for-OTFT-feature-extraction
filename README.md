# Improved-genetic-algorithms-for-OTFT-feature-extraction
Modified genetic algorithm that incorporates expert knowledge through controllers. The controllers act as a guide that allows us to go further than local minima. The specific application is to find parameters of organic thin film transistors (OTFT)

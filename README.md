# Improved-genetic-algorithms-for-OTFT-feature-extraction
Modified genetic algorithm that incorporates expert knowledge through controllers. The controllers act as a guide that allows the model to overcome local minima. The specific application is to find parameters of organic thin film transistors (OTFT)

The code is developed in Matlab. You'll find the main program with the name "EPT", that stands for the spanish version name (Extractor de Par√°metros de Transistores).
